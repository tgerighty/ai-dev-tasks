# Risk Assessment Framework

## Overview
This framework provides a systematic approach to assess risk levels for development tasks, enabling appropriate testing protocols, quality gates, and evidence collection requirements.

## Risk Level Classification

### Critical Risk (4.5-5.0)
**Characteristics:**
- Security-critical functionality
- Core system dependencies
- High user impact potential
- Complex integrations

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit + Integration + E2E + Security + Performance + Accessibility
- 95%+ code coverage required
- Comprehensive evidence collection
- Multiple review types (Security, Performance, Accessibility, Code, Architectural)

**Examples:**
- Authentication core engine
- Payment processing systems
- Data encryption/decryption
- Critical API endpoints

### High Risk (3.6-4.4)
**Characteristics:**
- Important business functionality
- Moderate user impact
- External integrations
- Performance-sensitive

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit + Integration + E2E + Performance
- 90%+ code coverage required
- Performance benchmarking
- Code and architectural reviews

**Examples:**
- OAuth2 integration
- User account management
- API rate limiting
- Database schema changes

### Medium Risk (2.1-3.5)
**Characteristics:**
- Standard business functionality
- Limited user impact
- Internal integrations
- Well-understood requirements

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit + Integration tests
- 80%+ code coverage required
- Code review

**Examples:**
- Form validation
- Basic CRUD operations
- UI component updates
- Configuration changes

### Low Risk (0.0-2.0)
**Characteristics:**
- Simple functionality
- Minimal user impact
- No external dependencies
- Clear requirements

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests only
- 70%+ code coverage required
- Basic validation

**Examples:**
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- UI styling changes
- Simple utility functions

## Risk Assessment Factors

### Technical Complexity
- Algorithm complexity (1-5)
- Integration requirements (1-5)
- Data sensitivity (1-5)
- Component dependencies (1-5)

### Business Impact
- User base size (1-5)
- Business visibility (1-5)
- Impact of failure (1-5)
- Revenue impact (1-5)

### Implementation Risk
- Expected defect rate (1-5)
- Software maturity (1-5)
- Team experience (1-5)
- Timeline pressure (1-5)

## Risk Score Calculation

The overall risk score is calculated using the following weighted formula:

```
Risk Score = (Technical Complexity × 0.4) + (Business Impact × 0.3) + (Implementation Risk × 0.3)
```

Each category is scored on a 1-5 scale, resulting in a final risk score between 1.0 and 5.0.

## Quality Gates by Risk Level

### Critical Risk Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing (95%+ coverage)
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed (WCAG AA)
- [ ] All required reviews completed
- [ ] Evidence collected and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated

### High Risk Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Required reviews completed
- [ ] Evidence collected and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Medium Risk Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Evidence collected and validated
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Low Risk Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing (70%+ coverage)
- [ ] Basic validation completed
- [ ] Evidence collected

## Evidence Collection Requirements

### Critical Risk Evidence
- **Test Reports:** Unit, Integration, E2E, Security, Performance, Accessibility
- **Coverage Reports:** 95%+ coverage with detailed analysis
- **Security Audit:** Vulnerability scan results, penetration testing
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Load testing, response time metrics
- **Accessibility Audit:** WCAG compliance testing
- **Review Documentation:** Security, Performance, Accessibility, Code, Architectural reviews

### High Risk Evidence
- **Test Reports:** Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance
- **Coverage Reports:** 90%+ coverage
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Load testing, response time metrics
- **Review Documentation:** Performance, Code, Architectural reviews

### Medium Risk Evidence
- **Test Reports:** Unit, Integration
- **Coverage Reports:** 80%+ coverage
- **Review Documentation:** Code review

### Low Risk Evidence
- **Test Reports:** Unit
- **Coverage Reports:** 70%+ coverage
- **Basic Validation:** Manual verification

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Assess Early:** Evaluate risk during task planning phase
2. **Be Conservative:** When in doubt, assign higher risk level
3. **Review Regularly:** Reassess risk if requirements or scope change
4. **Document Decisions:** Record risk assessment rationale for future reference
5. **Update Protocols:** Adjust testing requirements based on project experience
