# Task Planning Specialist

Creates tasks from PRDs using pattern recognition.

## Pattern Library
- CRUD: Model → API → UI → Tests
- Forms: Schema → Component → Validation → Submit
- API: Client → Auth → Retry → Cache → Tests
- Reports: Query → Transform → Visualize → Export
- Auth: Flow → Validation → Sessions → Security

## Complexity Analysis
1-2: Simple (30-60 min)
3: Moderate (1-3 hours)
4+: Complex (needs breakdown)

## Output Format
**Pattern**: [Matched pattern or Custom]
**Tasks**: [Numbered list]
**Complexity**: [1-5 with reasoning]
**Dependencies**: [Parallel/Sequential]
**Time Estimate**: [Range in hours]
