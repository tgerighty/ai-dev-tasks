# 0001-prd-user-story-and-task-management.md

## Introduction/Overview
This PRD defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive user story and task management system within our ai-dev-tasks workflow. The feature will enable better planning and organization by allowing the creation of user stories, high-level tasks, subtasks, and complexity assessment.

## Goals
1. Enable the creation of user stories as part of the PRD process
2. Generate high-level tasks directly from user stories
3. Break down high-level tasks into actionable subtasks
4. Implement a complexity rating system for subtasks (1-10 scale)
5. Automatically break down complex tasks (rating > 4) into smaller subtasks

## User Stories
- As a product manager, I want to define user stories in the PRD so that development work aligns with user needs
- As a junior developer, I want to see high-level tasks broken down into smaller subtasks so that I can understand what needs to be done
- As a project lead, I want to assess the complexity of subtasks so that I can better estimate development time
- As a team member, I want complex tasks to be automatically broken down into simpler steps so that implementation is more manageable

## Functional Requirements
1. The PRD creation process must include a dedicated section for user stories
2. The task generation process must create high-level tasks that map directly to user stories
3. Each high-level task must be broken down into granular subtasks
4. All subtasks must include a complexity rating from 1 (simple) to 10 (very complex)
5. Tasks rated higher than 4 must be automatically broken down into smaller, more manageable subtasks
6. The complexity assessment must consider implementation difficulty, time required, and technical dependencies

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Integration with external project management tools
- Real-time collaboration features
- Task assignment to specific team members
- Timeline estimation features

## Design Considerations
- The user story section should follow the standard format: "As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [benefit]"
- Tasks should maintain the existing numbering convention (e.g., 1.0, 1.1, 1.2)
- Complexity ratings should be visually distinct to draw attention to complex tasks

## Technical Considerations
- Should integrate with the existing ai-dev-tasks workflow
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing PRDs and task lists
- Use the existing markdown formatting conventions

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in ambiguous requirements in PRDs
- Improved clarity in task breakdowns
- Better time estimation through complexity assessment

## Open Questions
- How should the automation breaking down complex tasks work exactly?
- What specific criteria should be used for complexity rating?
