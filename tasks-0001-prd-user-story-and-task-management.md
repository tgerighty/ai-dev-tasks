## Relevant Files

- `create-prd.md` - Main PRD creation workflow that needs to be updated with user story guidelines
- `generate-tasks.md` - Task generation workflow that needs to be enhanced with complexity assessment
- `process-task-list.md` - Task processing workflow that may need updates for complexity tracking
- `README.md` - Documentation that may need updates to reflect new workflow capabilities

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use existing ai-dev-tasks process files as templates for the enhanced workflow
- All changes should maintain backward compatibility with existing PRDs

## User Stories

## Complexity Assessment Summary

### Total Tasks: 5 high-level tasks
### Total Subtasks: 18 (including breakdown subtasks)
### Average Complexity: 4.1
### Complex Tasks (>4): 9 subtasks requiring breakdown
### Simple Tasks (≤4): 9 subtasks

### Complexity Distribution:
- **1-2 (Simple):** 4 subtasks
- **3-4 (Moderate):** 5 subtasks  
- **5-6 (Complex):** 6 subtasks
- **7-8 (Very Complex):** 3 subtasks
- **9-10 (Extremely Complex):** 0 subtasks

### Automated Breakdown Applied:
- 5 complex subtasks were automatically broken down into 11 smaller, manageable subtasks
- All breakdown subtasks have complexity ≤ 4
- Parent tasks retained as summary/overview tasks
